GOOGLE SLIDES COPY-PASTE SCRIPT (PROFESSIONAL EDITION)
============================================================

--- SLIDE 1 ---
TITLE: Spine Sorter v5.51
SUBTITLE: Automated Asset Optimization & Pipeline Integrity
BODY:
*   Technical Artist / Animator Workflow
*   Runtime Optimization (VRAM/Disk)
*   Automated QC & Integrity Verification

--- SLIDE 2 ---
TITLE: Pipeline Objective
BODY:
*   Automates pre-export asset processing.
*   Optimizes build size via intelligent texture sorting (JPEG vs PNG).
*   Enforces build integrity by verifying internal export flags.
*   Standardizes output structure for engineering handoff.

--- SLIDE 3 ---
TITLE: Workflow (Standard Operation)
BODY:
1.  Target source directory containing `.spine` project files.
2.  Select specific skeleton/project file from queue.
3.  Execute processing pipeline ("Run Selected File").
4.  Review generated build report and error logs.

--- SLIDE 4 ---
TITLE: Feature: Intelligent Compression Sorting
BODY:
*   **JPG Pipeline:** Automatically routes fully opaque textures and "Additive" blend mode slots to JPEG to reduce specific disk footprint.
*   **PNG Pipeline:** Preserves Alpha channel for transparent/translucent assets and soft-edge gradients.
*   **Ref Isolation:** Segregates non-production reference images from the final build package.

--- SLIDE 5 ---
TITLE: QC: Export Flag Validation
BODY:
*   **[WARNING] Export Disabled (Skeleton)**
*   **Issue:** Entire Skeleton (e.g., "Reference") exists in project but is missing from export.
*   **Impact:** Major runtime crash (Missing Component).
*   **[WARNING] Export Disabled (Asset)**
*   **Issue:** Identifies active attachments with disabled "Export" flags.
*   **Impact:** "Missing asset" errors.
*   **Action:** Enable "Export" in Spine Tree view.

--- SLIDE 6 ---
TITLE: QC: Asset Integrity
BODY:
*   **[WARNING] Alpha Channel Conflict**
*   **Detection:** Assets in the "opaque" pipeline detected with non-zero alpha pixels.
*   **Auto-Correction:** Automatically reroutes to PNG pipeline to prevent white-halo artifacts at runtime.
*   **[WARNING] Broken References**
*   **Detection:** Validates internal JSON path references against local file system availability.

--- SLIDE 7 ---
TITLE: New: Animation Sync Validation
BODY:
*   **The Issue: Silent Export Failures**
*   Spine's "Export" checkbox for animations is local to the project file but critical for the runtime skeleton data.
*   Accidental unchecking results in successful builds but missing logic in-game (e.g., "Frozen" idle states).

--- SLIDE 8 ---
TITLE: Solution: CLI-Based Verification
BODY:
*   **Logic: Source-to-Binary Comparison**
*   **Introspection:** Queries the active Spine Editor CLI for the authoritative "Source of Truth" animation list.
*   **Analysis:** Parses the exported skeleton data (JSON).
*   **Verification:** Diffs the lists to ensure 1:1 parity between Source and Build.

--- SLIDE 9 ---
TITLE: Detection Heuristics
BODY:
*   Filtration of duplicates and system noise.
*   Multi-Version Support: Spine 3.8, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2+.
*   Deep Scan: Validates multiple skeletons per project (e.g., Reference vs Main).
*   Parser: Handles both legacy indented and modern comma-separated CLI output formats.

--- SLIDE 10 ---
TITLE: Build Report
BODY:
*   **Attachment Density:** Total slot/attachment count.
*   **Texture Atlas Paths:** Validated file paths processed for packing.
*   **Animation Parity:** Source vs. Export match count (e.g., 18/18).
*   **Compression Ratio:** Final breakdown of JPEG vs PNG texture count.

--- SLIDE 11 ---
TITLE: Configuration Profiles
BODY:
*   **Post-Process Launch:** Auto-load project in Editor for visual verification.
*   **Aggressive Compression:** Force opaque assets to JPEG (Recommended for Mobile/WebGL optimization).
*   **Legacy Mode:** Bypass sorting logic for maintenance of older project structures.
