GOOGLE SLIDES COPY-PASTE SCRIPT (PROFESSIONAL EDITION)
============================================================

--- SLIDE 1 ---
TITLE: Spine Sorter v5.55
SUBTITLE: Automated Asset Optimization & Pipeline Integrity
BODY:
*   Technical Artist / Animator Workflow
*   Runtime Optimization (VRAM/Disk)
*   Automated QC & Integrity Verification
*   Automatic Spine Version Management

--- SLIDE 2 ---
TITLE: Pipeline Objective
BODY:
*   Automates pre-export asset processing.
*   Optimizes build size via intelligent texture sorting (JPEG vs PNG).
*   Enforces build integrity by verifying internal export flags.
*   Standardizes output structure for engineering handoff.

--- SLIDE 3 ---
TITLE: Workflow (Standard Operation)
BODY:
1.  Target source directory containing `.spine` project files.
2.  Select specific skeleton/project file from queue.
3.  Execute processing pipeline ("Run Selected File").
4.  Review generated build report and error logs.

--- SLIDE 4 ---
TITLE: Feature: Intelligent Compression Sorting
BODY:
*   **JPG Pipeline:** Automatically routes fully opaque textures and "Additive" blend mode slots to JPEG to reduce specific disk footprint.
*   **PNG Pipeline:** Preserves Alpha channel for transparent/translucent assets and soft-edge gradients.
*   **Ref Isolation:** Segregates non-production reference images from the final build package.

--- SLIDE 5 ---
TITLE: QC: Export Flag Validation
BODY:
*   **[WARNING] Export Disabled (Skeleton)**
*   **Issue:** Entire Skeleton (e.g., "Reference") exists in project but is missing from export.
*   **Impact:** Major runtime crash (Missing Component).
*   **[WARNING] Export Disabled (Asset)**
*   **Issue:** Identifies active attachments with disabled "Export" flags.
*   **Impact:** "Missing asset" errors.
*   **Action:** Enable "Export" in Spine Tree view.

--- SLIDE 6 ---
TITLE: QC: Asset Integrity
BODY:
*   **[WARNING] Alpha Channel Conflict**
*   **Detection:** Assets in the "opaque" pipeline detected with non-zero alpha pixels.
*   **Auto-Correction:** Automatically reroutes to PNG pipeline to prevent white-halo artifacts at runtime.
*   **[WARNING] Broken References**
*   **Detection:** Validates internal JSON path references against local file system availability.

--- SLIDE 7 ---
TITLE: New: Animation Sync Validation
BODY:
*   **The Issue: Silent Export Failures**
*   Spine's "Export" checkbox for animations is local to the project file but critical for the runtime skeleton data.
*   Accidental unchecking results in successful builds but missing logic in-game (e.g., "Frozen" idle states).

--- SLIDE 8 ---
TITLE: Solution: CLI-Based Verification
BODY:
*   **Logic: Source-to-Binary Comparison**
*   **Introspection:** Queries the active Spine Editor CLI for the authoritative "Source of Truth" animation list.
*   **Analysis:** Parses the exported skeleton data (JSON).
*   **Verification:** Diffs the lists to ensure 1:1 parity between Source and Build.

--- SLIDE 9 ---
TITLE: Detection Heuristics
BODY:
*   Filtration of duplicates and system noise.
*   Multi-Version Support: Spine 3.8, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2+.
*   Deep Scan: Validates multiple skeletons per project (e.g., Reference vs Main).
*   Parser: Handles both legacy indented and modern comma-separated CLI output formats.

--- SLIDE 10 ---
TITLE: Build Report
BODY:
*   **Attachment Density:** Total slot/attachment count.
*   **Texture Atlas Paths:** Validated file paths processed for packing.
*   **Animation Parity:** Source vs. Export match count (e.g., 18/18).
*   **Compression Ratio:** Final breakdown of JPEG vs PNG texture count.

--- SLIDE 11 ---
TITLE: Configuration Profiles
BODY:
*   **Post-Process Launch:** Auto-load project in Editor for visual verification.
*   **Aggressive Compression:** Force opaque assets to JPEG (Recommended for Mobile/WebGL optimization).
*   **Legacy Mode:** Bypass sorting logic for maintenance of older project structures.

--- SLIDE 12 ---
TITLE: New (v5.55): Automatic Version Detection
BODY:
*   **The Challenge: Version Compatibility**
*   Spine projects contain version-specific binary formats (e.g., 4.1.24 vs 4.2.42).
*   Wrong version = "Unknown project format" error and processing failure.
*   Artists manage projects across multiple Spine versions simultaneously.

--- SLIDE 13 ---
TITLE: Solution: Smart Version Switching
BODY:
*   **Automatic Detection:** Reads version metadata from .spine file before processing.
*   **Dynamic Switching:** Temporarily modifies Spine Launcher settings to match required version.
*   **Seamless Processing:** Info, export, and import operations use correct Spine version.
*   **Auto-Restore:** Returns launcher to original version after processing completes.

--- SLIDE 14 ---
TITLE: Technical Implementation
BODY:
*   **Version Registry:** Scans system for all installed Spine versions on startup.
*   **Smart Matching:** Exact match preferred, falls back to closest major.minor version.
*   **Launcher Integration:** Modifies launcher settings file (start-1.json) per operation.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Handles both single launcher and multi-version installations.

--- SLIDE 15 ---
TITLE: Additional Fixes (v5.55)
BODY:
*   **JSON Path Updates:** Fixed mesh attachments now properly redirect between jpeg/png folders.
*   **Multi-Skeleton Packaging:** Multiple skeletons now correctly pack into single .spine file.
*   **Binary File Handling:** Improved error handling for version detection in binary .spine files.
*   **Artist Impact:** Eliminates manual version switching and reduces processing errors.
